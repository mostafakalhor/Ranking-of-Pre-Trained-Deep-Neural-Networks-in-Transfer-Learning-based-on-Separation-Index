# Ranking-and-Rejecting-of-Pre-Trained-Deep-Neural-Networks-in-Transfer-Learning-based-on-Separation-Index
Automated ranking of pre-trained Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) reduces the required time for selecting optimal pre-trained DNN and boosts the classification performance in transfer learning. In this paper, we introduce a novel algorithm to rank pre-trained DNNs by applying a straightforward distance-based complexity measure named Separation Index (SI) to the target dataset. For this purpose, at first, a background about the SI is given and then the automated ranking algorithm is explained. In this algorithm, the SI is computed for the target dataset which passes from the feature extracting parts of DNNs. Then, by descending sort of the computed SIs, the pre-trained DNNs are ranked, easily. In this ranking method, the best DNN makes maximum SI on the target dataset and a few pre-trained DNNs may be rejected in the case of their sufficiently low computed SIs. The efficiency of the proposed algorithm is evaluated by using two challenging datasets including Linnaeus 5 and COVID-CT. The experimental results indicate that SIs scores have a high degree of correlation with the ranking resulted from classification accuracy, even when a noisy or limited dataset is available.  Finally, the capability of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by comparing it with another approach using Mutual Information (MI).
