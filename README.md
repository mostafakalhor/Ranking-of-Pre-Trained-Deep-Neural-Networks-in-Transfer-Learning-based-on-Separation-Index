# Ranking-and-Rejecting-of-Pre-Trained-Deep-Neural-Networks-in-Transfer-Learning-based-on-Separation-Index
Automated ranking of pre-trained Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) reduces the required time for selecting optimal pre-trained DNN and boosts the classification performance in transfer learning. we introduce a novel algorithm to rank pre-trained DNNs by applying a straightforward distance-based complexity measure named Separation Index (SI) to the target dataset. In this algorithm, the SI is computed for the target dataset which passes from the feature extracting parts of DNNs. Then, by descending sort of the computed SIs, the pre-trained DNNs are ranked, easily. In this ranking method, the best DNN makes maximum SI on the target dataset and a few pre-trained DNNs may be rejected in the case of their sufficiently low computed SIs. The efficiency of the proposed algorithm is evaluated by using  COVID-CT images.This dataset consists of 397 negative and 346 positive cases, which is available in (COVID-CT-Dataset: a CT scan dataset about COVID-19. arXiv preprint arXiv:2003.13865). The experimental results indicate that SIs scores have a high degree of correlation with the ranking resulted from classification accuracy, even when a noisy or limited dataset is available.
